Search Document objects by semantic algorithm.

The `include_extra_fields` field returns additional fields into Document:
 - `chunked_text` - all chunks of document content;
 - `embeddings` - embeddings for each chunk.

Warning!
 - Using tokens field exclude query tokenizing - each other have the same responsibility;
 - The `model_id` field is optional and it replaced default value.
