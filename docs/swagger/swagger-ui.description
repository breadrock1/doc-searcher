# Doc-Search project

Doc-Searcher is the simple and flexible searching documents application, leveraging the capabilities of Rust and Opensearch
to provide efficient and effective full-text search in documents. This project aims to offer a straightforward solution for
indexing and searching through a large corpus of documents with the speed and accuracy provided by Opensearch.

The main goal is implement simple and powerful system of storing and indexing documents with searching functionality
(full-text, semantic and hybrid). I decided to use opensearch as default searching engine, but you may use own solutions
by implementing several async traits for Tantivy, QDrant or own solution.
