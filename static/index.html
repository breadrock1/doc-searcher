    <b>Doc-Search Project</b>
    <p>
        Doc-Search is the simple and flexible searching documents application, leveraging the capabilities of Rust and Opensearch
        to provide efficient and effective full-text search in documents. This project aims to offer a straightforward solution for
        indexing and searching through a large corpus of documents with the speed and accuracy provided by Opensearch.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main goal is implement simple and powerful system of storing and indexing documents with searching functionality
        (full-text, semantic and hybrid). I decided to use opensearch as default searching engine, but you may use own solutions
        by implementing several async traits for Tantivy, QDrant or own solution.
