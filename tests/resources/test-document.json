    "content": "I’ve spent the last four years building and deploying machine learning tools at AI startups. In that time, the technology has exploded in popularity, particularly in my area of specialization, natural language processing (NLP). At a startup, I don’t often have the luxury of spending months on research and testing—if I do, it’s a bet that makes or breaks the product. A sharp intuition for how a model will perform—where it will excel and where it will fall down—is essential for thinking through how it can be integrated into a successful product.",
